# Piano Project

This is my piano project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built an interactive piano keyboard using HTML and CSS that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Project Overview

The Piano project helped me learn how to create responsive designs that work across different devices. By implementing CSS media queries, I made a piano interface that changes its appearance based on the viewport size, showcasing responsive design principles.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Implementing responsive design with media queries
- Creating complex layouts with CSS positioning
- Building interactive elements that respond to user actions
- Using CSS variables for consistent styling
- Arranging elements precisely with the box model
- Working with pseudo-selectors for interactive states
- Creating keyboard-like interfaces with proper spacing
- Implementing responsive breakpoints for different devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with piano keys and container
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the piano and implements responsive design

## Design Elements

The piano features:
- White and black keys in the correct musical arrangement
- Realistic key proportions and layout
- Interactive hover effects on keys
- A responsive container that adapts to screen width
- The freeCodeCamp logo as a decorative element
- Different layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Key adjustments that maintain musical accuracy

This project was particularly valuable for teaching me how to make web elements adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining their functionality and visual appeal. The piano design required precise measurements and careful planning to ensure it looked correct at all viewport widths.
